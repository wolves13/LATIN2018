RNA sequences immediately start folding upon itself as they emerge from the RNA polymerase enzyme (\textit{cotranscriptional folding}). 
Geary, Rothemund, and Andersen have recently demonstrated the capability of cotranscriptional folding to manufacture an RNA molecule of an intended shape (rectangular tile) at nano-scale [Geary et al., \textit{Science}, 345(6198):799-804, 2014]. 
Using a novel computational model of cotranscriptional folding called the \textit{oritatami system} [Geary et al., Proc.~MFCS~2016, LIPIcs 58: 43:1-43:14, 2016], we shall initiate the theoretical study on algorithmic self-assembly of shapes by cotranscriptional folding.

Algorithms and computation are fundamental to molecular self-assembly as illustrated in their enormous success in DNA tile self-assembly. 
The Heighway dragon is a fine starting example in order to cut to the heart of algorithmic self-assembly by cotranscriptional folding because it is traversable algorithmically. 
An algorithmic way to traverse it is to feed a turtle program with the binary \textit{automatic sequence} RRLRRLLRRRLLRLL \dots as a direction to turn, whose $i$-th bit (starting from 0) can be obtained by giving a binary representation of $i$ from LSB to the DFA with output (DFAO) in Figure~\ref{fig:heighway_dragon} (Left). 
Our oritatami system combines the existing binary counter and copier modules with two modules: 
one implements the DFAO and computes the direction to turn from the current count $i$, which is propagated through a red line segment consisting of a counter and copiers; 
the other (green L-shaped block) bends the count $i$ leftward or rightward according to the direction just computed. 
The 6th iteration of the Heighway dragon, i.e., the first $2^{6}-1$ turns of it, folded by the proposed oritatami system is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:heighway_dragon} (Right). 
The system architecture is generic and works for an arbitrary finite portion of the Heighway dragon.
