\subsection{Verificaion}

We explain the correctness of the folding.
The folding of each module depends on its environment, i.e. on the components already folded nearby and on the current minimum energy conformations output by previous step.
Algorithm~\ref{alg:dragon} is an algorithm of designing the $n$-th iteration of the Heighway dragon.
It shows all possible environments of each module and component.
Using the simulator developed for \cite{HaKiOtSe2016}, we have verified that all of the components fold correctly in all possible environments.
