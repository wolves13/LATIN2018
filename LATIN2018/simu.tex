\subsection{Verificaion}
We explain the correctness of the folding.
The folding of each module depends on its environment, i.e. on the components already folded nearby.
Figure~\ref{fig:environments} shows all environments of each components.
Using the simulator developed for \cite{}, we have verified that all of the components fold correctly in all possible environments.
